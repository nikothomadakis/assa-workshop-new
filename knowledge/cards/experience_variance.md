# Experience variance

**What it is.** Experience variance is the difference between what actually happened and what the assumptions said would happen, for one driver: claims, lapses or expenses. It exists in two forms in this system:

- as **counts** in the `experience` tab (expected vs actual claims, expected vs actual lapses, expected vs actual expenses in rand), and
- as a **liability impact** in the `movement` tab (`claims_variance`, `lapse_variance`, `expense_variance`).

The count tells you what happened; the rand amount tells you what it did to the liability.

**The actual-to-expected ratio.** Actual ÷ expected. A ratio of 1.0 means experience matched assumptions. A ratio of 2.0 means twice as many events as assumed. Ratios on very small expected counts (below about 5) are noisy and should be interpreted with care.

**Sign is not favourability.** The buckets are signed as impacts on the liability. In most products, more claims or lapses than expected *release* reserves, so the liability impact is negative. Whether that is good or bad for the insurer depends on the product and on what was paid out:
- Excess surrenders on a Savings product remove account values: the liability falls by roughly what was paid, so the net effect is close to neutral.
- Excess death claims on a Protection product release a small reserve but pay a large sum assured: the liability falls slightly, but the insurer has lost money.
- Expense variances barely touch the liability at all; their real effect is on profit, which is outside this analysis.

So a negative variance is not "adverse" and a positive one is not "favourable". Say what happened and what it did to the liability; leave favourability to the product context.

**How to explain a variance.** Locate it (which cells), measure it (the count ratio), then look for a cause outside the numbers: the product spec's recent changes, a campaign, a premium change, an operational event.

**Initial scope — LM-2024.2.** Apply the main procedure's materiality rule before investigating a driver. Retrieve the cohort breakdown for a material experience component, but present and explain only the two largest cohort contributions by absolute amount. Keep the full component amount in the headline and disclose the selection method. Do not add the remaining cohort, a remainder line or a separate completeness reconciliation to the initial presentation. Use actual and expected experience for the selected cohorts with matching scope.

**On revision.** Apply the HAF's current review requirements. The same source tools retain all cohorts and can supply any additional supporting detail requested.

**When to pull this card.** When a `claims_variance`, `lapse_variance` or `expense_variance` bucket is material, or before interpreting a ratio.

**Related cards.** `liability_movement`, `product_specs`, `policy_data`.
